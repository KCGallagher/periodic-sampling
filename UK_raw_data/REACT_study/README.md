# REACT Study Analysis

All data is taken from the [REACT Github repository](https://github.com/mrc-ide/reactidd), from the [data](https://github.com/mrc-ide/reactidd/tree/master/inst/extdata) folder (accessed 21/09-2022). We have taken the decision not to include this package as a submodule in our reposistory due to its size, however all credit for this data goes to the [MRC Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) hosted within the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London.
